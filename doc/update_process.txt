Process for changing versions in Terrain3D
------------------------------------------

When releasing a new version:
* Set _version in src/terrain_3d.h
* Set version in project/addons/terrain_3d/plugin.cfg
* Set version in doc/conf.py
* Create a new branch for milestones so readthedocs will create a new version
* Rebuild the docs with doc/build_docs.sh
* Review minimum version in terrain.gdextension

If Storage has changed format:
* Set CURRENT_VERSION in src/terrain_3d_storage.h
